# runtime-comparision-of-mergesort-quicksort-and-heapsort-and-basic-working-report
### This program involves three sorting algorithms i.e Merge-sort, Quick-sort and Heap-sort. Then the program runs to sort a array of 1 to n using all three algorithms and returns the time taken by all of them to run. The algorithm with the least runtime is the fastest.
